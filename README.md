# Istanbul_Real_Estate_Price_Prediction
Online real estate companies are collecting large amount of data about properties. Our datasets is from one of those companies; "Milliyet Emlak". We acquired raw data from Big Data Hackathon Istanbul 2017; an event in which computer programmers and others involved in software development and data analytics.

Dataset (dated 10.12.2017) contains user's online real estate advert details such as prices, location, building's age. In this project, our goal will be to investigate data to find out what really effects the real estates prices in Istanbul on 2017 and make predictions for sale adverts.
